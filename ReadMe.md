This is a simple standalone application that reads a field in a MySQL database and returns the number of new rows 
based on a specific criteria. In my application, the DB field checking criteria was a boolean 0 or 1. 

The output is a Bootstrap Badge that is updates every 5000ms and changes color if the value is above 0.
